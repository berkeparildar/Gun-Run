# Gun Run

This is a hyper casual mobile game I developed using Unity. It has similar gameplay mechanics to other runner games where the player controls a moving gun on a platform, shooting obstacles with unique power-ups while collecting chargers to upgrade the gun. The levels are randomly generated and the difficulty gradually increases.
